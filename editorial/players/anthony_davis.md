# Injury Reality Check: Anthony Davis

## What the injury label says
Day-to-day. Questionable. Maintenance.

## What the history actually tells us
Anthony Davis is a managed-availability star.
He plays often, but unpredictably.
The downside is a sudden zero, not gradual decline.

## What usually happens next (7–21 days)
- plays most games
- misses cluster around dense schedules
- variance increases before shutdowns

## Fantasy implications (daily-moves leagues)
- trust on single-game slates
- hedge on back-to-backs
- stream around, don’t replace

## Bottom line
Elite ceiling.
Fragile floor.
Requires active management.
